# Simple Svelte Native App

This is an almost like-for-like copy of the examples that ship with the official Svelte Native repo [here](https://github.com/halfnelson/svelte-native/tree/master/demo). 


Tested successfully on an M1 Mac with both iOS and Android simulators.

To run:

```
cd myapp
npm install
npm run
```
